# Setting Up Your GitHub Repository

Follow these steps to create a new GitHub repository and push your Detroit Lions website project:

## Step 1: Create a new GitHub repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in with your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Repository name: `detroit-lions-website`
4. Description: `A modern, responsive clone of the Detroit Lions official website built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.`
5. Keep it as a public repository
6. Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license as we already have these files
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect your local repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to connect your existing local repository.

Run these commands in your terminal:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project directory (you're already there)
# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/PkTaz/detroit-lions-website.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

You'll need to enter your GitHub username and password or personal access token when prompted.

## Step 3: Verify your repository

1. After pushing your code, go to https://github.com/PkTaz/detroit-lions-website
2. You should see your project files and the beautiful README displayed on the repository page

## Step 4: Update the README links

1. Now that your repository is live, edit the README.md file to update:
   - The GitHub Repository link to: `https://github.com/PkTaz/detroit-lions-website`
   - If you deploy the site (e.g., with GitHub Pages or Vercel), update the Live Demo link

## Congratulations!

Your Detroit Lions website is now on GitHub for the world to see. You can share the repository link with others to showcase your work!
